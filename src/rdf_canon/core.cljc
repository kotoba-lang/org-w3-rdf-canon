  "RDF Dataset Canonicalization (RDFC-1.0) — [W3C REC](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-canon/).

   Second layer of the `-rdfc-` cryptosuite stack. `nquads.core` fixes the bytes for
   a term; this fixes which *blank node labels* those bytes carry, so that two
   parties holding the same graph produce the same hash even though blank node
   labels are arbitrary.

   ## Complete, including N-degree hashing

   All of §4.4.3 is implemented: first-degree hashing (§4.6), Hash Related Blank
   Node (§4.7), and the Hash N-Degree Quads algorithm (§4.8) that resolves blank
   nodes *sharing* a first-degree hash by exploring the graph around them.

   N-degree hashing is the part worth explaining, because it is where the cost is.
   When two blank nodes cannot be told apart by their own quads, RDFC-1.0
   distinguishes them by the shortest \"gossip path\" through their neighbours — and
   it finds that path by trying **every permutation** of the related nodes at each
   step, recursing as it goes. That is factorial work, which is why:

   ## The work limit is a spec requirement, not a nicety

   §4.4.3 states that implementations **MUST** defend against denial of service \"by
   raising suitable exceptions and terminating early\". A 10-node clique of mutually
   referencing blank nodes is a tiny document that would otherwise run effectively
   forever; the official test suite ships exactly that as `test074`, and the only
   correct answer is to refuse.

   So every N-degree call and every permutation examined draws down `:max-work`, and
   exhausting it throws `:rdf-canon/work-limit-exceeded`. Raise it deliberately if
   you own the input; do not raise it for input from strangers, which is the case
   this limit exists for.

   The default's margin is measured, not guessed: across the official suite the
   heaviest legitimate vector spends **3,348** units (`test044`/`045`/`046`, the
   \"deep diff\" cases), the next heaviest only 54, and the clique exceeds even a
   2,000,000-unit budget. So the distribution is sharply bimodal and the default sits
   about 30x above every real document while still refusing the attack promptly.

   ## Correctness is measured, not asserted

   `test/fixtures/rdfc10/` holds the **entire official W3C test suite** — 64
   canonical-form vectors, 21 issued-identifier-map vectors and the poison test —
   checked in so the suite needs no network. Every claim this library makes is
   checked against W3C's own expected output, byte for byte. A canonicalizer that
   only agreed with itself would be worthless: the whole point is that two
   independent parties produce the same bytes.

   ## Code point order, not UTF-16 order

   §4.4.3 orders serialized quads and hashes in *code point* order. A JVM string
   compare is UTF-16 **code unit** order, and the two differ for supplementary
   characters: a surrogate pair leads with 0xD800-0xDBFF and so sorts before
   U+E000-U+FFFF under code units, and after them under code points.
   `compare-code-points` implements the specified order rather than the convenient
   one.

   (Note this is the OPPOSITE requirement to RFC 8785 JCS, which explicitly wants
   UTF-16 code unit order for property names. Two specs, two orders, and using one
   library's comparator for the other's job is a silent interoperability bug.)

   ## Hash algorithm

   SHA-256 by default; `{:hash-algorithm :sha384}` selects the OPTIONAL SHA-384
   variant the spec names and the suite covers. The digest is threaded through every
   layer rather than hardcoded, because the first-degree and related-node hashes
   feed the final one — mixing algorithms between layers would produce a hash nobody
   else computes."
